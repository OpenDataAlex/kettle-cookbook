kettle-cookbook
===============
Kettle-Cookbook is an auto-documentation tool for Kettle, a.k.a. 
Pentaho Data Integration (http://kettle.pentaho.com/).
It generates human readable documentation in HTML format for 
collections of Kettle .ktr / .kjb files. 

Kettle-cookbook is open source (LGPL), and is available from 
google code: http://code.google.com/p/kettle-cookbook/

Kettle-cookbook is itself built as a Kettle solution. 
To use kettle-cookbook, you have to run the document-all.kjb kettle
job located in the pdi directory. The job accepts two parameters:

INPUT_DIR: the directory containing the .ktr/.kjb files
OUTPUT_DIR: the directory where the generated documentation will be 
stored.

You can run the document-all.kjb from the kettle IDE spoon, or run
it from the command line using the kitchen tool. For more detailed
instructions, see the wiki pages on the google code project:
